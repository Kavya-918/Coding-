Problem:
You are given an integer N, reverse the digits of given number N, ensuring that the reversed number has no leading zeroes.
Return the resulting reversed number.

Example 1:
Input: 200
Output: 2
Explanation: By reversing the digts of 
number, number will change into 2.

Solution:
class Solution
{
    public long reverse_digit(long n)
    {
        long rev = 0;
        while(n > 0)
        {
            long rem = n%10;
            rev = (rev * 10) + rem;
            n = n/10;
        }
        return rev;
    }
}
